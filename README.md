1.) pragati.py: This is a python module I created, which contains 10 different recursion problems that can be solved just by importing them. 
2.) ATM.py: This project simulates a simple banking system with four users. Each user has a predefined username, password, pin code, and account balance. The program prompts the user to enter their username and, if valid, takes them to the ATM menu. The menu offers four options: withdrawal, deposit, account balance, and change password. The user must enter their pin code for authentication. If incorrect, access is denied. The program updates the user's account balance based on their transactions and allows password changes with confirmation.
